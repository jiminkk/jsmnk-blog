I'm choosing to dream again. To set ambitious goals, to strive hard toward these goals, and find my people to achieve these dreams with.

Lately, it's been harder to find and feel inspiration. I've been feeling bogged down by job hunting and felt consequentially lackluster, lost, thinking that perhaps I'm misaligned with my skills. That I don't have the right support group for diligent practice, nor am receiving right and enough feedback to improve. Feeling compared and contrasted from others. I have of course felt lost before, but this current phase has been feeling much less grounding.

Music or cigarettes made it all feel worse, sinking myself deeper into a depressive state. Out of desperation, I reached out to my old and new friends. Sending out belated texts of "happy new year" and "miss you"'s because as I genuinely missed every single one of them, I was feeling their absence even more sharply now. Then after attempting to code for a second, I found myself checking discord and re-discovered some acquantainces and their work-in-progress blogs from writing club, and clicking into [some](https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2023-07-31-pursue-your-dreams/) of their blogs and reading people's intros, the beauty in expressing something honestly, the purity of writing, and the daily feeling of cranking out writing late at night all came back rushing back. Slowly mending and warming what's been feeling so aloof and cold lately. I was reminded that we could pursue something purely out of love, purely out of desire, and that it's something you cannot base your ego to.

I remember when my friend during our Europe graduation trip asked me a question - to which I don't remember in detail - but I do remember responding to his question, valiantly exclaiming to our friend group at the table that before dying I many desires I must meet, that I must form a girl gang of motorcyclists, play the drums, go sky dive, fly a seaplane, fall in love, travel to india, nepal, eastern europe, antarctica. I just burst on, fueled on fire, and I've largely felt this fire die out slowly and more frequently as time crawled and flew by, and it's made me sad, and I'm trying to figure out why. I was largely known to be excited by a lot of things, but nothing amuses much anymore. Not to be a downer or anything. 

And then I realized you could just *dream again*. 

It may have been due to this crawling feeling of age, thinking that after all of this time, you must sort of decide and settle, but age does not matter, and you're just comparing and blaming on everything else but yourself for falling off the rail with writing, with programming, with reading. It's about generating! You want to put things out there! Don't mind what society needs more or less of; it's more about focusing on what you can provide and generate, rather than thinking of the bigger picture and where you may fit in. If you need something, if you feel the desire especially, you must just simply do it, despite what everyone else is doing. Comparison is a thief of joy. It's a bit of deep pessismism there that I don't like to admit, but it's present and admittedly fateful.

So I'd like to dream again. Even in a state of hardship, even if the tunnel feels darker than ever before. Because dreaming is the only way to make it out of the tunnel. Because I need it for survival. 

I dream about creating beautiful music to portray my life story.
I dream of creating a music video with my best friends. 
I dream of dancing in it with my friends. 
I dream of performing in a musical with best friends. 
I dream of creating a bicoastal community that serves both coasts. 
I dream of having warm beautiful friends and family around at all times. 
I dream of creating a world that's beautiful, safe, and playful for all humankind.
