I'm choosing to dream again. To set ambitious goals, to strive hard toward these goals, and find my people to achieve these dreams with.

Lately, it's been harder to find and feel inspiration. I've been feeling bogged down by job hunting and felt consequentially lackluster, lost, thinking that perhaps I'm misaligned with my skills. That I don't have the right support group for diligent practice, nor am receiving right and enough feedback to improve. Feeling compared and contrasted from others. I have of course felt lost before, but this current phase has been feeling much less grounding.
