I'm a programmer, open mic co-host, retired musician, occasional writer, frequent dreamer. 

I like writing, creating whatever comes to my mind because I like to think my experiences and a daily craftsmanship provide the foundation and fuel for what comes out of my body, my mind. For an ideal outcome, the actual process of creating must come from within, in a state of peace and calm, to replicate a blank canvas and a free mind. And to get to this place, I believe you must do the work and train yourself to sit through the time and let breathing inspire you. 

Anyway that's how this about me page is being formed as of now. 

I like to think that we're also systems, biological systems, that can be sometimes encapsulated in a framework but oftentimes also triggered by randomness. Well, I think it's mostly randomness + inborn characteristics, but as beings with a mind, we can manage that randomness in our heads to work in our favor. For instance, we can build habits that will in consistent effort get ingrained and integrated in our systems, the way we want ourselves to work. And that's powerful because we are human beings with dreams, and it means we have some capability to try and achieve the dreams we want. And that's a wonderful privilege and power to have, to wield, in this world.

I love music, visual arts, quantum physics, film, biking, the pacific coast, urban landscapes. I seek beauty in a lot of things and mediums I experience. I'm working on confronting myself more and really listening to others. I'm trying to reflect more frequently, more intentionally. I could probably eat pasta every day.
